         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170172:6"/>upon the Expoſition of this Pſalme in my owne Cure: Not knowing but that God might afford me that honour to preach my owne Funerall Sermon. I am ſure whilſt I handled it, it proved ſo to others that heard it. Now what ſubject could be more neceſſary for ſuch times of common motta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity then this? It was the wiſdome and care of <hi>Joſeph of Arimathea, Joh.</hi> 19.41. To have his Tomb in a Readineſſe in his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. And why in his Garden? But that in the midſt of all his delights and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, he might be put in mind of his Death, and might prepare for it And indeed <hi>That man may truly be ſaid to live, that is alwaies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to dye.</hi> It was Gods Ordinance at the Inſtitution of the Paſſover, <hi>Ex.</hi> 12.11. That it ſhould be eaten thus, <hi>VVith their Ioynes girded, their Shoes on their feet, with their ſtaffe in their hands, and to eate it in haſt.</hi> No doubt the reaſon of all this was, That they might be in a continuall readineſſe when God ſhould call them to paſſe out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Canaan.</hi> The ſpiritual uſe ſtill remaines; That we ſhould alwaies be prepared for our paſſage out of the Egypt of this world into the Celeſtiall Canaan. And herein could my pen have aſwered my Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this ſubject, or thoſe enlargements of the Spirit that many times we meet withall, in our publike Miniſtry, (which none can expect) It had not appeared ſo liveleſſe as here it doth. And howſoever I may ſeeme to light a candle to the Sun, in theſe times wherein ſo many exquiſite pens

                  <p>In the Pſalm it ſelfe, wee have three particulars.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. An acknowledgement of Gods goodneſſe and mercy to their Forefathers <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob:</hi> and to their poſterity, in protecting them from their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and that in many dangers: Even for his own names ſake and his mercifull Covenant <hi>ſake unto them.</hi> v. 1, 2.</item>
                     <item>2. From the third <hi>ver.</hi> to the 12 there is a <hi>Narration,</hi> in the which is ſet down the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon frailty and mortality of mankind: And this he doth</item>
                     <item>1. Generally from <hi>ver.</hi> 3. to the 7. wherein <hi>Moſes</hi> compares mans life to a <hi>watch in the Night,</hi> to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170172:10"/>a <hi>Flood,</hi> to <hi>Sleep,</hi> to <hi>Graſſe,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
                     <item>2. In particular, that their eſtate was far worſe then the Common eſtate of the reſt of mankind: for whereas the life of man ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily is 70. years, or 80. yeares, their life was far ſhorter by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Gods Judgements upon them for their ſins, they were ſuddainly waſted and conſumed.</item>
                     <item>3. An humble <hi>Supplication</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the people unto the Lord, that he would in mercy turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Judgement, and return again unto them in mercy: and grant them gracious deliverance and his former favour.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Concerning the occaſion of this Pſalm;
<note place="margin">The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the Pſalm.</note> It is like that it was penned by <hi>Moſes,</hi> when as the ſpyes returned from ſearching the Land of <hi>Canaan. Numb.</hi> 14. In the thirtieth of <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> wee may ſee how the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſend twelve men of the heads of the tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to ſearch the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn after forty daies, and bring of the firſt fruits of the Land. Now all of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170172:10"/>them (<hi>Joſuah,</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> excepted) diſcourage the people, telling them that their Cities were ſtrong, and their walls high, and that there were the Sons of <hi>Anak,</hi> of the generation of Gyants, and that theſe would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them. Onely <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> incourage the people to ſet upon that Land.</p>
                  <p>The people hearing this, they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, wiſhing that they had dyed in <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Lord hearing of the murmuring of the people, was angry, and told <hi>Moſes;</hi> that of all them that had ſeen his Miracles in <hi>Aegypt</hi> upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and at the red Sea, there ſhould not one of them come into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> But that great multitude even ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand that came out of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> that were above the age of twenty years, <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> excepted, ſhould periſh in the Wilderneſſe, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.37.</p>
                  <p>This being the occaſion of this Pſalm: Wee may firſt note,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> what a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170172:11"/>grievous thing it is in the ſight of God for thoſe that have had experience of Gods mercy in former times, to call his power into queſtion, and to deſpair of his mercy for future times.</p>
                  <p>This people had many times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of Gods power, his goodneſſe and mercy in many great deliverances: As in their deliverance from <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> at the red Sea; How did the Lord there fight for this people? when <hi>Pharach</hi> and his Hoſt purſued them, when the Sea was before them, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> behind, the Mountains on each hand of them, that they could ſee no means left them to eſcape. Yet how did the Salvation of the Lord appear in their deliverance. Beſides, hee had given them much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of his mercy and goodneſſe in the Wilderneſſe, giving them <hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven, and water out of a Rock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now after all this to doubt of his providence, and to call his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in queſtion, and to make God a lyer, in that they would not believe that he would, or was able to bring
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170172:11"/>them into the promiſed land, was ſuch a ſin, as the Lord did puniſh moſt ſeverely, as we may read, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>Now this calling of Gods power and goodneſſe into queſtion by ſuch as have had experience thereof, muſt needs be a hainous ſin.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe God is ſo highly provoked by this ſin. See <hi>Pſalm</hi> 78.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Marvelous things did he in the fight of their Fathers,

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He clave the Rock in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and gave them drink.</hi> And ſo goes on in that Pſalm, to ſet forth the great deliverances, that God, from time to time, ſhewed unto his people.</p>
                  <p>But here was their ſin.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> 
                     <hi>For all this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170172:12"/>they believed not his wondrous works but limited the holy one of</hi> Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>And therefore this <hi>made way for his anger,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> and he ſpared not their ſouls from death, but gave their life to the peſtilence.</hi> This ſin above all others provokes to wrath.</p>
                  <p>This ſin of calling Gods power and goodneſſe into queſtion,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> by ſuch as have had experience of the ſame, is quite contrary to the nature and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Faith in the ſoul. We can in nothing more glorifie God, then by living the life of Faith,
<note place="margin">Heb. 2.4</note> 
                     <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi> And this was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, that he ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbeliefe.
<note place="margin">Rom. 4.20.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>So on the contrary part, no ſin doth more diſhonour God, as when we limit the holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and dares not truſt him in times of ſtraights;

                     <hi>He that believeth not, hath made him a lyar.</hi> And what greater diſgrace can be caſt upon any, than to give him the lie.</p>

                  <hi>They could not enter in becauſe of unbeliefe.</hi> This was the ſin of the Prince of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that when the Prophet had told him of the great plenty that ſhould be in the gate of <hi>Samaria,

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170172:47"/>him to death in the gate of the City.</p>
               <p>Yea, the Lord hath ſeverely puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed this ſin in his own ſervants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that have been guilty of it; as we may ſee in <hi>Moſes</hi> the man of God,

So that the point is clear and plain, that our corrupt nature is ſuch, that we often call Gods power into queſtion, in times of ſtraights that we fall into.</p>
               <p>Becauſe it was the firſt ſin of our Father <hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> by the which Sathan entered into mans heart,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.4.</note> and ſo drew him from God to queſtion Gods love, and the ſame is derived to all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. And this is the root and mother of all other ſins; by it we depart from God, when we call Gods power, truth, promiſes,

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170172:48"/>make God a lyar,
<note place="margin">1. Joh. 5.10.</note> and ſo diſhonour God in a high degree. As we cannot honour God more, than by ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his name,
<note place="margin">Numb. 20.12.</note> and acknowledging his power in times of affliction and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe: So is God highly diſhonoured when we doubt of his power and goodneſſe, and call the ſame into queſtion.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> as it is the work of Faith to ſee God to be of power All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, to help and ſuccour us in times of ſtraights.

<note place="margin">Rom. 4.20.</note> for he was <hi>perſwaded, that what he had promiſed he was able to perform.</hi> Whereas the unbelieving heart blocks up the gate of mercy againſt it ſelfe, and makes a man uncapable of mercy.</p>
               <p>If we examine our ſelves by this Doctrine,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> we ſhall finde, that we are guilty in ſome meaſure of this ſin: when our eſtate goes not ſo well with us as we deſire, how ready are we to thruſt off the cauſe of it from our ſelves, and to lay it upon others.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170172:48"/>When we are in health, peace, and proſperity, and ſet free from trouble, O, then we can acknowledge and ſay, that God is all-ſufficient, mercifull, and gracious. But if the Lord ſend af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, ſickneſſe, tryalls, times of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity; then we are ready to call all into queſtion, and think that Gods power is ſhortned; we dare not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low God in the dark: we can hardly confeſſe God to be almighty, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, juſt, mercifull, at ſuch times,
<note place="margin">Iudg. 6.13.</note> but are ready to ſay with <hi>Gideon, If God be with us, why is this befallen us?</hi> We ſhorten Gods arme, and call his power into queſtion, as this people did, <hi>Can God furniſh a Table in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?
<note place="margin">Pſal. 78.</note> He gave us drink indeed out of a Rock, but can he give bread alſo?</hi> This is that ſin which this curſed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ours is moſt prone unto; and therefore are the more carefully to watch ouer our own hearts againſt it.</p>
               <p>Seeing it is the ſinne of our nature thus to queſtion Gods power,
<label type="milestone">

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170172:49"/>learn to know that God is alwaies one &amp; the ſame, moſt mighty, moſt juſt, true, &amp; faithful in his Covenant towards his people. Though our condition change, yet God changeth not, he is one and the ſame from all eternity, and cannot change. But if our condition be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with us than we deſire,
<note place="margin">Lam 3.39. Eſ. 59.2.</note> let us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe all to our ſelves. <hi>Man ſuffereth for his ſin. Your iniquities have ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated betwixt you and your God. Your iniquities have turned away theſe things, and your ſins have withholden good things from you.</hi> Let us condemn our ſelves, and accuſe our ſelves, that we are thus afflicted; and know that God is juſt, and the arme of his power is not ſhortned towards his people.</p>

                  </label> But how comes it to paſſe, that the Lord ſeemes thus to leave his people ſo long a time, in ſuch fore affliction and diſtreſſe as his people here?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>

                  </label> The Lord doth this in much wiſdome and love to his people.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to bring them to a clearer ſight of their ſins, and to work in them a greater meaſure of humiliation for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170172:49"/>the ſame, then yet they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto. We are apt to think, that a little ſorrow for ſin is enough, and every light and ſlight confeſſion will ſerve the turn: But the Lord ſees it meet, that the foundation of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and converſion ſhould be laid deeper.</p>
               <p>Secondly, herein, and hereby, the Lord will exerciſe our graces, which in times of Gods delaies are exerciſed in us. How was the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> exerciſed, whilſt he took <hi>Iſaac</hi> in his hand three daies together, when he went up to the Mount to ſacrifice him? How was the faith of <hi>Paul</hi> tried, when he received this anſwer from God <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> though the temptation was not remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</p>
               <p>The Lord will have it ſo,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the prayers of his people ſeeking him. The Canaanitiſh woman had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers denyalls in her ſuit to Chriſt in the behalfe of her daughter, yet at laſt had a gracious anſwer returned unto her. And this is ordinarily the fruit of ſore afflictions, they produce fervency

<label type="milestone">

                  <p>This duty the Lord requires and looks for at our hands,

                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> was of another mind, he looks not ſo much upon the <hi>Caldeans</hi> and <hi>Sabeans,</hi> that plundered him of his goods and cattle, but he looks up unto God, and acknowledgeth his hand in all.

                  <p>The firſt may be taken from that everlaſting Covenant of grace that God hath made with his children,

<note place="margin">Comforts from the Doctrine of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> that a true believer may receive from the knowledge of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all this will arme us againſt the feare of Death. Tis true, there is ſomething in death that breeds feare,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and horror and dread, that makes fleſh and blood to ſhrink, and to tremble. To lie in the grave and there to bee eaten up of wormes, and to bee made ſubject to corruption, &amp;c. yet this may be our comfort, that ere long we ſhall be raiſed out of this condition, to a bleſſed and glorious eſtate. It is but the putting off our cloathes at night, we ſhall put them on againe in the morning. Shall we bee like unto little children that cry when they put off their cloathes?</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this may comfort us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all our troubles and ſufferings that we meete withall in the world. The worſt that Tyrants can doe, is but
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170172:70"/>to kill the body; yet when they have done that, and put them to the greateſt cruelty and torture that they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, they ſhall be reſtored to us againe. This was that comfort that Chriſt gave to his Diſciples,
<note place="margin">Mat. 20.19.</note> when he ſpake of his owne death. <hi>The Son of man ſhall be delivered to the chiefe Prieſts and Scribes, and they ſhall condemne him to death, and deliver him to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to be Crucified; but the third day he ſhall riſe againe.</hi> Now that which was Chriſts comfort may be ours alſo.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is comfort in it,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in regard of our friends that die in the Lord, that though death may ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate us aſunder for a time, yet we ſhall meet again. If a man take a long jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, his wife &amp; friends do not weep &amp; lament as if they ſhould never ſee him again: So a man that dies in Chriſt, though he take a long journey, yet we ſhould not mourn, as thoſe which have no hope, we ſhall meet again.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> this may alſo comfort us, in regard of the preſent infirmities of our bodies, blindneſſe, lameneſſe, crookedneſſe, and other deformities,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170172:71"/>that we are ſubject unto here: In the Reſurrection, we ſhall leave all theſe behinde us in the grave, and our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhall riſe again glorious bodies, and incorruptible bodies. As thoſe two godly Martyrs going to the ſtake, the one blinde, the other lame, comforted each other: Be of good cheer, Brother, my Lord of <hi>London</hi> will this day cure thee of blindneſſe, and me of my lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Thus will death do, and in the Reſurrection, theſe imperfections ſhall be done away. So that the comforts are great, which flow from this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>But as this Doctrine ſerves for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of comfort and conſolation to the godly,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>3</label> ſo it ſerves for matter of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, fear, and aſtoniſhment, unto all wicked and unregenerate men, that are out of Chriſt, that as they live, ſo die in a naturall eſtate. 'Tis true, theſe alſo ſhall partake of this Reſurrection, and ſhall riſe again at laſt, but in a ſarre different manner from the godly.</p>
                  <p>The bodies of believers ſhall ariſe by vertue of that union they have with Jeſus Chriſt, as members of that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170172:71"/> body of his, whereof Chriſt is the head, ſo ſhall he at laſt draw his members to himſelfe.</p>

               <p>IN this Verſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> proceeds to a farther deſcription of the frailty of mans life.</p>
               <p>And whereas our corrupt nature is ſuch, that we are ready to think, we ſhall never die, or not yet, or not for many years, though we ſee daily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, ſuch as are young and ſtrong go before us; yet cannot men eaſily be perſwaded, that their life is ſo ſhort, as indeed it is.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Moſes</hi> comes to ſhew, that even the longeſt life, any man lives or yeares that he can attain unto, is but a ſhort life, and very uncertain. He ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth thus; Suppoſe that a man
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170172:76"/>ſhould attain to live a Thouſand years, which no man ever did as yet attain unto; no the longeſt life that we read of in the Word, is but nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſixtie nine years that <hi>Methuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi> lived. But ſuppoſe, ſaith he,
<note place="margin">Gen. 5.27.</note> that a man might live a thouſand yeeres, alas, what is the ſpace of a thouſand yeers, if we compare it to the eternity of God, it is but as a <hi>day when it is paſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now by this proportion, let us mark how ſhort the life of man is. A thouſand yeeres is but as a day, then what is the ordinary life of man, which is but ſixty yeeres, or eighty years, ſurely it is not an houre, a poor time to brag of as many do.</p>
               <p>And in the end of this Verſe, as though <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid too much, and pointed our the life of man too long, he ſeemes to correct himſelfe, <hi>q. d.</hi> What, ſaid I, that the life of man is as <hi>yeſterday, when it is paſt?</hi> Nay, I ſay, <hi>It is but as a watch in the night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now a <hi>Watch</hi> was but the ſpace of three houres,

Such will the time of Death and the laſt judgment be. And upon this ground, Chriſt grounds that exhortation of his, to have our loynes girded, and our light burning, that we may be alwaies ready. And certainly, when men are moſt ſecure, then is death neareſt at

                  <p>The point then is clear and plain that as death comes as a <hi>Flood,</hi> and there is no reſiſtance; ſo as a <hi>Flood,</hi> death comes ſuddainly, when men think leaſt of it.</p>

<label type="milestone">

                  <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That many times death comes ſuddainly like a <hi>Flood,</hi> when men think leaſt of all on death. Alas, do we not ſee, that on the Stage of this world, ſome therebe, that indeed do act a longer part, and many there be that act a ſhorter: ſome die in their youth, paſſing as it were from one grave to another, from their Mothers womb, to another womb, the earth: How few live to the age of fiftie? How many do we hear of daily, that go well to bed at night, and are found

                  <p>Secondly, conſider,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that this is but one of the old Serpents wiles to put off our repentance, and preparation for death, to the laſt: for Sathan knowes, that if he can but prevail in that, it is all one, as if men reſolved never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent at all: for we ſee by experience, that not one of a thouſand, which take this courſe, ever attain unto it; for they adjourn from year to year, and time to time ſo long, that they come at laſt to be hardened in their ſins, that there is little hope of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: In youth we appoint the time of age, in age we appoint the time of ſickneſſe, and when ſickneſſe comes, the Lord knowes we are then moſt unfit for this great work: Then comes the cares of diſpoſing of our eſtates, then comes pain and grief, loath we are to die, and in hope we are to live; theſe things take off our thoughts of another life, and ſo death feizeth upon us, and away we muſt.</p>

Nay, is it not diſtributive juſtice now in God, to refuſe to hear thee then, that refuſeſt to hear him now? It is not uſuall with God to give grace in death, who have deſpiſed grace in life.

                  <p>IN this laſt ſimilitude, the Prophet compares Man to <hi>Graſſe,</hi> that as <hi>Graſſe</hi> hath a time of growing, and a time of withering; even ſo man is like unto <hi>Graſſe,</hi> for he hath alſo a time of growing, and a time of withering.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the morning they are as graſſe which groweth up.</hi> In which words, <hi>Moſes</hi> compares the former part of mans life, which is the ſpace of thirty three yeeres, to the time of growing of <hi>Graſſe,</hi> and that is accounted the time of the perfection of mans ſtrength and age; at which age, according to the courſe of Nature, Man flouriſheth as <hi>Graſſe</hi> doth; that is the time of a mans prime and flouriſhing eſtate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But in the Evening:</hi> That is when the <hi>Graſſe</hi> is ripe, and ready to be cut down, <hi>It withereth.</hi> Even ſo Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once at his ſtrength, and ripeſt age, doth not ſtand at a ſtay, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170172:94"/>long ſo; but preſently begins to decay, and to wither away, till old age come, and he is cut down by the Syth of death.</p>
                  <p>Now in that <hi>Moſes</hi> uſeth ſo many ſimilitudes, and all to ſhew how frail this life of man is, we are taught:</p>
                  <p>That the frailty, vanity,
<label type="milestone">

<note place="margin">The life of man ſo frail, as no exam ples can expreſſe.</note> as examples will ſcarcely ſhew it. Death comes as a <hi>Flood,</hi> violently and ſuddainly; we are as a <hi>Sleep;</hi> we are as <hi>Graſſe;</hi> our life is like a <hi>Dream;</hi> we ſpend our daies <hi>as a Tale that is told, verſe</hi> 9 All theſe ſimilitudes <hi>Moſes</hi> hath in this Pſalm, as if he wanted words and examples; how to expreſſe the vanity, frailty, and ſhortneſſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>The ſimilitudes uſed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to expreſſe the frailty, vanity, and brevity of mans life, are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and very ſignificant.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> compares our life to a <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
<note place="margin">1 Chr. 29.15.</note> Our daies on earth are as a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and there is no abiding.</hi> A ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, we know, hath no ſubſtance in it, and is of no long continuance. It is compared to a <hi>Vapeur,</hi>

                  <p>And beſides this, that our life is ſo frail ſhort, and vain, this very ſhort time that we continue here, is ſubject

                  </p>
                  <p>And if the beams of Gods anger and wrath, ſends forth ſuch terrible leſtruction upon us here, what will that wrath of his be, when it ſhall be fully powred out upon his poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in hell for ever? <hi>Our God is a conſuming fire.</hi>

O the miſery of that wretched ſoul, that lies under Gods wrath! If all the infirmities that

                  <p>For as the loving kindneſſe of God is <hi>better than life it ſelfe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſ. 63.3.</note> ſo the ſenſe and feeling of his wrath and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, is that which wounds their ſouls to the quick, ſo as there can be no comfort, no joy, no reſt, nor peace, but ſorrow, griefe, vexation, and trouble of heart.

                  <p>It is the loſſe of credit, detriment in eſtate, ſhame, puniſhment, or the like, that affects them; ſelfe love works it in them, and were it not for ſhame, puniſhment, hell, or torment for ſin they would live and die in their ſins. <hi>Cain</hi> cries, but why? <hi>My puniſhment is greater then I can bear.

                  <p>But now come to a child of God, a gratious heart indeed, that hath in it the work of grace; his ſorrow is principally for the evill of ſin, that God hath been offended, and his righteous Law violate; and if there were no danger at all in ſin, either of ſhame, puniſhment, here, or hereafter, yet this wounds their ſouls, and grieves their hearts, that they have diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God, and brought upon them Gods diſpleaſure.</p>

<label type="milestone">

<label type="milestone">

                  <p>This may ſerve for matter of tryal, whether we have made the right uſe of our ſufferings, yea or no, which may be known by this; If we have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thoſe corruptions in us, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were undiſcovered.</p>
                  <p>Many are at that paſs to bear off croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and afflictions with head and ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as they ſay.

<note place="margin">Ier. 10.19.</note> 
                     <hi>It is my ſorrow and I will bear it.</hi> Why the beſt have their afflictions and whom God loves them he chaſteneth and with theſe and the like conceits men put off Gods ſtrokes and dealings with them.</p>
                  <p>But alas where is that ſearching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our own hearts and wayes, to finde out our ſins that have not yet been diſcovered, the cauſe of Gods anger and diſpleaſure? few make this uſe of Gods judgements, to ſay, <hi>What have I done?</hi> what are thoſe ſins I am guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170172:134"/>of that have provoked the Lord to be thus angry with me? But it may be truly ſaid of many of us in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and miſeries,
<note place="margin">Eſ. 42.25.</note> 
                     <hi>He hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and he knew it not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is the reaſon the Lord ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times brings long and laſting ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and afflictions upon us, till we be brought to know our ſelves, and finde out thoſe ſins, for the which the Lord is ſo diſpleaſed with us.

<note place="margin">Iob 10.2. &amp; 13.23.</note>

<label type="milestone">

                  <p>Indeed the preaching of the Word is the ordinary means whereby God doth break the ſtony heart of man this is Gods Hammer,
<note place="margin">Ier. 23.</note> appointed by him to that end. It will make the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt heart to quake, and tremble as <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> did; and the moſt deſperate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to be humbled, as thoſe wicked Jews that had imbrued their hands in the blood of the Lord Jeſus.
<note place="margin">Act. 2.37</note> It is a two-edged ſword cutting both wayes.</p>
                  <p>But when that will not ſerve the Lord can clap ſuch irons upon the ſoul and conſcience as can make the ſtouteſt heart to buckle. As the Lord dealt with <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> laid him in cold irons, and then he knew <hi>that God was the Lord.</hi> Thus dealt he with the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 16.</note> the <hi>Jaylor,</hi> and with this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple here, by ſharp and ſore afflictions, he makes way many times for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: So that we may cry out with

                     <hi>Paul,
<note place="margin">Rom. 11.33.</note> O the deepneſs of the riches both of the wiſdome and knowledge of God? how unſearchable are his judgements, and his wayes paſt finding out.</hi> Surely the greatneſſe of his wiſdome and power is wonderful, that by ſo many means can work good to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>And laſt of all this may ſerve for matter of terror unto ſuch that have been in the furnace of affliction,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>3</label> and have had the hand of God lien heavy upon them, yet have not been bettered by them, to finde out their ſins; and to be humbled for them; there is few families amongſt us but have felt Gods hand in our late viſitation.

                  <p>But alas, the Lords hand hath been upon many of us, upon ſome in one kinde, and upon others in another, and yet they are not bettered. It was a ſad complaint that the Lord takes up

                  <p>Take we notice firſt of all of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> Example and Practice herein. When <hi>Nathan</hi> by his parable had convinced him of his ſins, of Adultery and Murther and that his heart ſmote him for the ſame, theſe ſins he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.13.</note> 
                     <hi>I have ſinned</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord.</hi> And how heavy the guilt of thoſe ſins lay upon his ſoul,
<note place="margin">Pſ. 51.</note> we may ſee in that penitential Pſalme
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170172:137"/>of his, by his manner of begging par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>Waſh me, cleanſe me, blot out; reſtore me to the joy of my ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet as though all this were not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, he accuſeth himſelf of that, which <hi>Nathan</hi> did not, by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the very root and ſpawn of all thoſe evils,
<note place="margin">ver. 5.</note> ſaying, <hi>Behold, I was ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceive me. David</hi> will no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger flatter himſelf in his ſinful courſes and ſecret ſins, but confeſſeth all, and begs pardon of all;
<note place="margin">Pſ. 19.12</note> 
                     <hi>Cleanſe thou me from my ſecret faults.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O how ready are theſe wretched hearts of ours to deceive us in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: If our hearts ſmite us, and our conſciences accuſe us for ſome groſſe ſin or other that we have committed, and the world cries ſhame of, and we confeſſe the ſame to God, and beg par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for it, we think all is well: In the mean time there is a world of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that lies hid in the ſoul we ſee not,
<note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> the very <hi>thoughts and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our hearts being evil continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and all our righteouſneſs,</hi> even
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:170172:137"/>our beſt duties themſelves, <hi>are as a menſtruous cloth;</hi> and <hi>When we have done all that we can we are unprofitable ſervants,</hi> and have cauſe to pray with good <hi>Nehemiah,
<note place="margin">Neh. 13.21.</note> O my God pardon me according to the greatneſs of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> And without this ſenſe of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal depravity of our Natures, and of thoſe ſecret ſins that cleave to us in our beſt duties, our proneneſſe to all evil, our indiſpoſition to any thing that is good; the blindneſſe of our Underſtanding, the rebellion of our Wills, the diſorder of our Affections, and that indeed we carry about us a very Body of ſin, and can be humbled for theſe, and repent of theſe as well as for our groſſe ſins, we are ſtrangers to godly ſorrow and true repentance.</p>
                  <p>And the firſt Reaſon may be taken from the nature of true Grace,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> and godly ſorrow for ſin. If this be true, ſincere and unfained, it will ſet it ſelf againſt every ſin, and will work an univerſal change in the whole man; at leaſt in an unfained deſire and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in the heart, though by and by it cannot ſubdue and bring under every
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170172:138"/>ſin, yet it will ſet it ſelf againſt it, and will be humbled for it. The nature of true Grace is to make the inſide cleane as the outſide; it worketh faith in the ſoul: and it is the nature of faith, to <hi>purifie the heart;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 15.9.</note> and the heart being clean and pure, the thoughts, the words and actions of the life, will in ſome good meaſure be ſutable.</p>
                  <p>May be taken from the nature of God,

                     <hi>All my wayes</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>are before thee; there is not a word in my tongue, but thou, O Lord, knoweſt it altogether;</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> acknowledgeth,
<note place="margin">Iob 42.4.</note> 
                     <hi>There is no thought hid from thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as the Lord ſees and obſerves our wayes, ſo he will not fail to judge every man according to his works,

                  </p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:170172:138"/>
                  <p> So then whether we conſider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of true Grace, that albeit it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubdue every corruption by and by, yet will it ſet it ſelf againſt all and is humbled for all; or that God ſees and beholds our moſt ſecret ſins, and will not fail to puniſh them. This ſhews the Doctrine to be clear, That godly ſorrow and true repentance doth reach to the moſt ſecret ſins.</p>
                  <p>This ſerves to diſcover unto us in what a miſerable eſtate and condition many in the world are in at this day;
<label type="milestone">

                  <p>O how far are ſuch from the grace of true Repentance, whoſe property is to ſet it ſelf againſt our moſt ſecret corruptions, ſince our moſt ſecret ſins are ſuch as the Lord will moſt ſeverely reckon for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> ſin for the which the Lord
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170172:139"/>would not ſuffer him to come into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was a ſecret ſin in his heart, yet how ſeverely did the Lord puniſh this ſin in his ſervant?</p>

<note place="margin">Acts 8.</note> 
                     <hi>If perhaps the thought of his heart might be forgiven him.</hi> So that there is no true repentance when men are not humbled for their moſt ſecret ſins.</p>
                  <p>And Gods children that have the truth of grace in their hearts, are as much humbled for their ſecret ſins, for their privy and cloſe ſins, their ſinful thoughts, and luſts of their hearts, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, neglect of duties, coldneſſe in prayer, &amp;c. they be oft brought upon their knees for theſe.</p>
                  <p>And this ſhews the folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thoſe likewiſe, that if they can but commit their ſins in the night when none can ſee them, as to ſteale, commit Adultery, &amp;c. think all is well: whereas though thou mayeſt hide thy ſins from men, yet even thy moſt cloſe and ſecret ſins are open and naked in the ſight of God, his All-ſeeing eyes were then upon thee; he took thee in

                  <p>Seeing it is ſo ſure a note of godly ſorrow and true Repentance,
<label type="milestone">

                  <p>This may ſerve to juſtifie the wayes and courſes of the godly, againſt all thoſe ſcoffs and taunts of wicked and graceleſſe ones daily caſt upon them for piety ſake, that they are ſo ſtrict, and ſo preciſe in every thing, even in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the ſmalleſt moment that they love ſingularity, and deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of that liberty and pleaſure that others enjoy, they will not ſwear nor drink for company, nor run with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers into the ſame exceſſe of riot,</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed this they do not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dare they do it; and this is indeed the main cauſe why the world hates them: But it is better that men ſhould hate us for good, then that God ſhould plague us for evil.</p>

                  <p>The Lord knows with what minde you come to the Word, with what minde you come to the Sacrament, with what hearts you come to prayer, or any duty you perform to him: Why ſhould we halt and diſſemble with him, who is the ſearcher of the heart?</p>

                  <p>Secondly, this may admoniſh us, that if the Lord ſhall at any time thus deal with us, as with his people here, and ſend us long and tedious afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in our bodies, mindes or eſtates, by trouble of minde, ſickneſſe, pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, loſſes, croſſes, or the like, we are not therefore to deſpair, or preſently to think that God loves us not, but hath caſt us off.</p>
                  <p>Shall we not drink of the cup that Chriſt himſelf drank off We pray, <hi>Thy will be done:</hi> Now if it be his will that we ſhall thus ſpend our daies in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and miſery, our very paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in ſuffering Gods <hi>Will</hi> be to done upon us brings not leſſe glory to God, then when we actually doe his will.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                     </label> that the Lord ſhould thus ſuffer his own people to lie thus ſoaking in affliction ſo long? is not this an argument of his anger againſt them?</p>
                  <p>The Lord is never ſo diſpleaſed with his children, as to <hi>hate</hi> them,

                  <p>A Father, when he correcteth his Child, the Child thinks his Father is angry with him, yet even then he loves his Child dearly, when he doth moſt ſharply correct him. So when the Lord laies his Rod upon us, in the ſharpeſt manner, we think God is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and wrathfully diſpleaſed with us; when he doth that which a Father doth, when he is angry.

                  <p>But to ſuch as are in Chriſt, the malignity of the Croſſe is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and laid upon Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not properly puniſhments unto them, but chaſtiſements and Fatherly corrections, inflicted upon them in <hi>Mercy,</hi>

                  <p>HEnce we may obſerve, how ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible the effects of Gods anger and wrath for ſin is. That mans life being ſo ſhort of it ſelfe, by Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and diſpleaſure for ſin, is made more ſhort. Note hence:</p>
                  <p>That when God is angry,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his anger is terrible.
<note place="margin">The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible.</note> The infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and murmuring of this people, brought ruine and deſtruction upon many thouſands, who were miſerably waſted and conſumed, now that the wrath of God was kindled againſt them.</p>
                  <p>But herein we muſt be exceeding carefull,
<note place="margin">Anger of God what.</note> that we conceive not amiſſe of God.</p>
                  <p>It is true, the Scriptures frequently make mention of Gods <hi>anger</hi> and <hi>wrath;</hi> but we muſt know, there is a great difference betwixt theſe ſinfull paſſions in our corrupt nature, and theſe eſſentiall properties that are in God.</p>
                  <p>He is angry and ſins not; but our
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:170172:151"/>anger and wrath is mixed with ſin and therefore evill.</p>
                  <p>Gods anger and wrath is as pure and holy as his mercy is, being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the execution of his juſtice.</p>
                  <p>So that this <hi>anger</hi> and <hi>wrath</hi> in God, are not in God according to paſſions, whereunto God is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but according to the effect. As when God chaſteneth for ſin, he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth unto us to be angry, and ſo we judge of God according to humane ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>The termes thus explained, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>That the effects of Gods anger and wrath are very terrible; His anger is a conſuming anger, and his wrath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voures to deſtruction.
<note place="margin">Ier. 3.9. Pſ. 2.5. Heb. 12.29. Deut. 32.22.</note> It is called a <hi>fierce wrath, ſore diſpleaſure,</hi> a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire.</hi> As <hi>Moſes</hi> hath it, <hi>For a fire is kindled in my anger, and ſhall burn to the loweſt hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conſideration hereof made the Church to pray ſo earneſtly, <hi>Turn us, O God of our ſalvation,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 85.4, 5.</note> and releaſe thy anger towards us for ever. Wilt
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:170172:151"/>thou prolong thy wrath from one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to another?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How earneſtly do they beg and in treat to be diſcharged of Gods anger, and that they might enjoy his former favour and countenance again.</p>
                  <p>And if we look into thoſe examples in the Word whom God hath made ſpectacles of his anger and wrath for fin; who can but conclude, that the effects thereof are terrible.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the example of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe it is the wrath of God,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> and ſo the higheſt wrath, and the ſoreſt wrath. Now if the wrath of a King, a mortall creature is <hi>as the roaring of a Lion,</hi> O what is the wrath of God? the wrath of man can but reach to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:170172:152"/>the bodies and eſtates of men, but the anger of God reacheth to the ſoul; the anger of men is finite, the anger of God is infinite, as himſelfe is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> the effects of the anger of God muſt needs be terrible, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his anger is as himſelfe is, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, <hi>Who knowes the power of thy wrath,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes?</hi> And the dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the word anger and wrath, denotes the heat and fury of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure; that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Church apprehended deeply the ſenſe of Gods indignation againſt them for their ſins for God is angry at nothing in his creatures but ſin.</p>
                  <p>But do not the ſins of the godly ſo far provoke Gods wrath,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                     </label> as utterly to deprive them of his love and favour?</p>
                  <p>No,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> we muſt take heed of ſuch thoughts as theſe. What though the ſins of his people do deſerve his anger and wrath, yea, his everlaſting wrath and condemnation it ſelfe: yet his anger and diſpleaſure doth never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them out of his love.</p>
                  <p>He is angry, and ſins not, ſince he is only angry at ſin; as a Father that
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:170172:152"/>ſees a Serpent in his Childs boſome, he hates the Serpent, but loves the Child: So here, God is not angry with his children to deſtroy them, but with their ſins to ſave them.</p>
                  <p>And howſoever the ſins of his Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen may ſo far provoke the Lord to wrath, as to turn his ſmiles into frownes, which God many times doth by their ſins; and thoſe fruits of his love, are many times turned into the effects of his hatred, in outward appearance; yet then, even then, are they beloved of him, and the Lord is about to do them good. God never hates any, whom he once loved in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Neither can any ſin of any of Gods Elect, cauſe the Lord to reject them, though the Lord hates ſin in them; yet he ſtill holds a fatherly affection towards them.</p>
                  <p>Let us apply this.</p>
                  <p>Seeing the effects of Gods anger and wrath are ſo terrible,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> we may hence obſerve the difference betwixt the anger of God, and the anger and wrath of man.</p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:170172:153"/>
                  <p> Mans anger and wrath proceeds from corruption within, which is quickly provoked to any thing that croſſeth it.</p>
                  <p>But Gods anger and wrath is ever at ſin, which is ſo contrary to that holy and pure nature of his, that he will not fail to correct, even in his own children. O how happy were we, if we could bring our hearts to this, to be <hi>angry,
<note place="margin">Eph; 4.26.</note> and ſin not,</hi> to make ſin the object of our anger and wrath in our ſelves and others: As <hi>Moſes,</hi> though he were the meekeſt man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, yet when the people had made the golden Calfe, he cauſed the ſame to be grownd to powder, and made the people in a holy anger and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation to lick up the duſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p>Thus was the zeal of <hi>Phineas</hi> kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled againſt <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Coſbi,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting judgment upon them, Gods wrath was appeaſed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>2</label> ſeeing the effects of Gods wrath for ſin are ſo terrible what then is ſin, the cauſe of Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? In all diſeaſes, we ſay, the cauſe
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:170172:153"/>is worſe then the effect. Now all the plagues and judgments that God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuteth in the World, are but the effects of ſin. We have ſeen in our times the great alterations that have been in Church and State; the Crown it ſelfe is withered, many Noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and Houſes brought down and laid in the duſt, Inheritances tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to others, the Sword hath begot a new tenure, confuſion in the Church, Sects and Hereſies abound in every corner, the Ordinances of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned and deſpiſed, the Miniſtry ſlighted and diſeſteemed, as if it were uſeleſſe and might be ſpared: never more open prophaneneſſe, nor aparent ſignes of Gods anger and wrath againſt a people, then God hath manifeſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, with his unwonted judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and ſtrange viſitations, by unwonted ſickneſſes and diſeaſes. Surely, in the midſt of them all, we are to juſtifie God, ſince <hi>England's</hi> ſin hath cauſed all our plagues upon us this day; and we are to confeſſe with the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Church, that it is the Lords mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy we are not quite laid waſt: That
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:170172:154"/>it might be ſaid of <hi>England,</hi> that we were a people that kept not Covenant with God.</p>
                  <p>And when we ſhall ſee Religion advanced, diſcipline and order in our Church, Sects and Hereſies diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced, Piety encouraged, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe ſuppreſſed; then, and not till then, may we hope that God will remove his wrath, and turn away his anger from us.</p>
                  <p>And laſt of all,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> this may ſerve for <hi>Exhortation,</hi> to admoniſh all to take heed of ſin; we ſhall never eſcape Gods anger nor diſpleaſure, whilſt we are guilty of ſin; ſin laies us naked and open to all judgments.</p>
                  <p>But eſpecially this concerns Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, that as they deſire to keep off Gods judgments from a Land and Nation, that they ſee that ſin be duly puniſhed: When <hi>Phineas</hi> executed judgment, the <hi>Plague ceaſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this care ought Parents and Heads of Families to have, that as they deſire protection from God, and to ſee his bleſſing upon their Families, that they ſuffer not an

                  </p>
                  <p>There is one thing more to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that as the effects of Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and wrath are terrible:</p>
                  <p>So it is the ſight of ſin,
<label type="milestone">

                     <note place="margin">Sight of ſin, and ſenſe of Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure for ſin, ground of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration of Gods anger and diſpleaſure againſt ſin, that is the ground-work and foundation of true repentance.</p>
                  <p>There are many excellent fruits of godly ſorrow and true repentance ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted by this people, from verſe 12. to the end; yet, if we obſerve well theſe two verſes, 8, 9. we ſhall ſee it was the ſight of their ſins, and the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods anger and diſpleaſure for ſin, that ſet them upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
                  <p>The fight of ſin, and the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Gods anger and diſpleaſure for ſin, ever goes before true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. This Church and people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that God had ſet <hi>their

                  <p>And ſurely this is Gods order of working, in the great work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Salvation; firſt, to caſt down through the ſight of ſin, and apprehenſion of Gods diſpleaſure for ſin and then to raiſe up in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of mercy in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Never did any truly repent, but firſt apprehended the curſe, and Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt ſin before. Let this be duly thought upon as a moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ground of truth, that thoſe whom the Lord intends to ſave, he will firſt diſcover unto them their ſin, and Gods wrath due unto them, even the curſe of the Law, which is eternal death of Soul and Body for ever, before he ever give them the ſweet apprehenſion of his favour and love in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The Scriptures are clear and plain in this point; <hi>Come, let us return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord,
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 6.1.</note> for he hath wounded us:</hi> Where we ſee the Lords order firſt to <hi>wound,</hi> and then to binde up. Thus

<note place="margin">Deut. 28.66.</note> Thy life ſhall hang in doubt before thee, and thou ſhalt fear day and night.</hi> Now it is with a ſoul in this plight, as it was with <hi>Balſhazar</hi> in his cups,

                     </gap>oul, before he fills it with mercy.</p>
                  <p>Baloved, let us not flatter our ſelves, to think, that repentance and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God were a matter ſo eaſily got: No, no, the Lord will have us into the furnace firſt, and the Lord will make us to ſee our ſins, and to

<note place="margin">Eſ. 61.1.</note> 
                     <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord is on me, and the Lord hath annointed me, and ſent me to preach good tidings to the poor, to binde up the broken hearted, to preach liberty to the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, &amp;c.</hi> Here you ſee to whom Chriſt is ſent, and here is a ſoul qualified for mercy; not all and every one that lives under the Goſpell, that hath been Baptized, and goes under the name of a Chriſtian; but ſuch only as are ſenſible at their ſpirituall miſery and thraldome by reaſon of ſin. <hi>I

                  <p>Secondly, till we thus ſee ſin,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> and are ſenſible of Gods wrath and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure for ſin, we ſhall never prize Chriſt, neither are fit to receive any comfort from Chriſt. When a poor ſoul comes truly to ſee fin, and the wrath of God due for ſin, and that ſin is a burthen, too heavy for that ſoul to bear, Chriſt will never be pretious to the ſoul, <hi>The full ſoul loatheth the hony comb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But take a poor wounded ſoul, whoſe heart is truly humbled, it is like a ſmitten Hart; O, to the ſoyle it fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,

                     <hi>As the Hart brayeth after the Rivers of water, ſo longeth my ſoul after thee, O God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let ſuch a ſoul have all the treaſure in the world preſented unto him on the one hand, and the leaſt drop of the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170172:157"/>blood of Chriſt on the other hand: O, it is Chriſts blood that he priſeth above all. As <hi>Rachel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Jacob, Give me Children, or elſe I die;</hi> ſo ſaith a poor ſoul, Give me Chriſt for the pardon of my ſins, or elſe I die, and ſhall periſh for ever.</p>
                  <p>This ſerves to diſcover unto us what is Gods manner of dealing in the work of mans Converſion and Salvation;
<label type="milestone">

                  <p>Well then, would you know how it fares between God and your ſouls; call to minde your ſins paſt, the ſins of your youth, the ſins of your middle age, and the ſins of your riper years, and ſee how your hearts ſtand affected towards them: Can you think of them without griefe of heart? have you as

                  <p>Our life is ſhort, if we do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what our childhood is, and how much of this time was ſpent in that ſtate of life, which cannot truly be termed life indeed; for, howſoever in childhood and youth we had wit and diſcretion to diſcern good and evill, yet there wanted that reaſon and underſtanding to chooſe the good and refuſe the evill: ſo that part of our life was paſt without any fruit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we could truly be ſaid to live; for ſo long as we know not God, nor
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:170172:161"/>wherefore he created us, and are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the end wherefore we were ſent here into the world, we cannot properly be ſaid truly to live.</p>
                  <p>When we come to riper years, and come to our ſelves, as <hi>Solemon</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that encreaſeth knowledge, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth griefe:</hi> Then do the cares of the world, and the thoughts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for Wife and children take up our thoughts and time, that we mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr our ſelves, and our life is full of miſery.</p>
                  <p>Let men come to the age of fiftie years, doth not death then by their gray haires ſummon them daily, though neither ſickneſſes nor diſeaſes do aſſail us; yet we may then perceive that nature decayes, and we draw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace towards our long home.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe (as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith) that we draw upon eightie years, are not our lives then a burthen unto us, whilſt we wreſtle daily with aches, pains, griefs, and a world of infirmities, that old age is ſubject unto; all which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our lives a burthen to our ſelves, and no leſſe are we burthenſome to others.</p>

                  <p> How frail then and how miſerable is the life of man? And indeed, that time cannot truly be ſaid to be long, that at laſt ſhall have an end.</p>
                  <p>So that all things conſidered, there is more detracted from mans life, then added to it.</p>
                  <p>Infancy is ſwallowed up with child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, childhood with youth, youth with riper years; and both infancy, childhood, youth, and riper years, are all ſwallowed up of old age, and old age with death: So that our continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance here cannot truly be called <hi>Life,</hi> but a continuall paſſage from the womb to the grave.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if we conſider, the halfe of this time of ſeventie years is ſpent in ſleep, which it a kinde of death, and is halfe our time: And out of the other halfe, if we would ſubduct our child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, time ſpent in ſickneſſe of body, trouble of minde, ſo much time ſpent in doing nothing, ſo much time in doing little, we ſhall finde at laſt, that our daies and time on earth, may eaſily be meaſured by the ſhort Ell of a few daies, as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid to <hi>Pharaoh,

                  <p>And as for <hi>Example;</hi> the Scriptures afford us divers in this kinde, of the faithfull, that in times of miſery and diſtreſſe have made the Lord their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuge to flie unto, and have found comfort and deliverance: as that of

                  <p>Whereas wicked and ungodly, men here is their miſery; they are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the very means of deliverance, they cannot pray. Let them perform this duty,

                     <hi>God heareth not ſinners. If I regard wickedneſſe in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſ. 1.15.</note> How doth the Lord proteſt againſt the Jews, that though they ſhould ſtretch forth their hands to him, he would hide his eyes from them; and though they ſhould make many prayers, he would not hear, becauſe their hands were full of blood.</p>

                  <p>God beſtows theſe indeed many times upon wicked men,

                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>David</hi> prayed moſt earneſtly for the life of the child,

                  <p>God many times delaies his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>1</label> when hee doth not deny to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them, for now is the time when the Lord is pleaſed to exerciſe his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the hearts of his ſervants, as faith, hope, patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For what would become of theſe graces, if there were no more but ask and have. No doubt Chriſt heard the requeſt of the poor Canaanitiſh woman at firſt, but it was after many requeſts that hee anſwered her, delighting in her often calling upon him, <hi>Joſias, Jeſus, mercy, mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> there may be ſome ſin or other, even in the godly themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered, and unrepented of, that for the preſent may cloud their prayers, and which may lie as a bar in their way, that God doth not by and by return them an anſwer; which when they have diſcovered, and by true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance have removed, then God will not fail to return them a gracious anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> God many times denies this own ſervants in the particular thing
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:170172:207"/>deſired. As <hi>Paul</hi> that would have had the Buffettings of Sathan removed.
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.</note> But the Lord anſwered him in another kind, giving grace in the ſtead thereof to ſupport him. <hi>My grace</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is ſufficient for thee.</hi> Thus doth God many times when wee ask for Silver, give us gold. Somthing or other equivalent thereto; as when wee ask for Earthly bleſſings, if hee give us Heavenly, hee is not behind-hand with us.</p>
                  <p>Thus long life is promiſed as a bleſſing in the keeping of the fift Commandment to children that obey their Parents: yet we know that many obedient children die young, as <hi>Jeſus</hi> did, yet the Lord makes good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in giving them a better life. Yea, Chriſt himſelf, when he prayed that the cup might paſſe from him: yet did he drink of it, yet was heard in his prayer, when God gave him ſtrength to bear it, and withall an Angel to comfort him.</p>
                  <p>And laſt of all, in all our prayers and requeſts that we put unto God, we are tyed to certain conditions, which

                  <p>What a condition was the Church in, in <hi>Jezebels</hi> time, that ſlew the prophets of the Lord, inſomuch that <hi>Elias</hi> thought himſelfe alone; yet, what a ſuddain alteration was there, when <hi>Eliah</hi> ſlew the Prophets of <hi>Baal,</hi> and reſtored religion again.</p>
                  <p>How was the Church of God in Chriſts time peſtered by the High Prieſts, who had given commiſſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Saul,</hi> to binde, and to deliver bound at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> all that made profeſſion of Chriſt; yet, at another time, <hi>had the Churches peace, and multiplyed.</hi>

                  <p>And who doth not finde this true by experience in himſelfe, ſometimes to feel much joy and comfort in himſelfe;
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:170172:244"/>yet, by and by, either by ſome ſin that they have fallen into, or by ſome cloud of affliction or other, that joy is eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and to be loſt for a time.</p>
                  <p>As we ſee the trees in winter ſeem to be dead; as though they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver grow again; yet, when the ſpring comes, the heat of the ſun revives them again.
